In this code, an arbitrary sub-string is searched in a text without using String libraries.
Both entered text and entered sub-string must be all in small letters. Then, the program capitalizes repeated sub-strings in the text, so that it is visually distinctive.
Here, lists are used.
In case sub-string method from String Libraries is used, there would be no need to use lists.
This code is NOT efficient!
